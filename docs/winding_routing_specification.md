Winding Routing Specification
=============================

This service maps winding values to rotation angles for artwork orientation before overlaying dielines. Values 1–4 represent standard windings; 5–8 are the inverted equivalents on the roll.

Mapping
- 1 → 180°
- 2 → 0°
- 3 → 90°
- 4 → 270°
- 5 → 180° (inverted of 1)
- 6 → 0° (inverted of 2)
- 7 → 90° (inverted of 3)
- 8 → 270° (inverted of 4)

Operational note
- For inverted windings (5–8), a rewind step in production is typically required so the final orientation matches press expectations. Practically, 90° inverted corresponds to 270° after rewinding, and vice versa.
